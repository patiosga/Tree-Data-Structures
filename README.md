# Tree-Data-Structures
 AVL and Binary Tree C++ Implementations

This is a project i made for my second semester Data Structures course. It  
reads a text file and counts the appearances of tokenized word-couples. It then  
procceeds to organize them in an AVL and a Binary Tree and test their execution times  
while building the structure and while searching tokens.
